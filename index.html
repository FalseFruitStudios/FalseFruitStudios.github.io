    <h1>What Is 3D Printing?</h1>

    <h3>So what is 3D printing ?</h3>

    <p>3D printing is the commonname used when referring to the current generation of additive manufacturing equpiment, espcially the home tier machines that have rapidly gained traction within hobbyist communities. </p>

    <p> Common 3D printers function by melting plastic "filament" commonly made of ABS or PLA to a high temprature, and then extruding the molten plastic to build a 3D object layer by layer from an original digital model.</p>

    <p>The additive nature of 3D printing means that far less materials are neccessary to create a object when compared with traditional subtractive manufacturing such as CNC carving. </p>

    <p>3D printing enables you to produce complex functional shapes using less material than traditional manufacturing methods. </p>
