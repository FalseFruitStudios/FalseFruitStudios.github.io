    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <p>While the tools page gave a rough overview of the various tools you may use when working on 3D printed parts, and figures, this page exists to cover the more complicated, and involved techniques relating to those tools.</p>
    <h2>Acetone Vapour Finishing</h2>
    <h4>The Method With Potentially Explosive Results.</h4>
    <p>Acetone Vapour is dangerous. Fullstop. The End.</p>
    <p>It's not something to take lightly due to the incredibly flammable nature of acetone, and it's own proclivity to dissolve plastics into sticky piles of nothingness.</p>
    <p>So what is acetone vapour finishing?</p>
    <p>Simply put its a process wherein you use acetones natural ability to melt plastic to carefully smooth the surface of a 3D printed object, either by naturally letting vapour form in a container with the print (the safe way) or by heating a vessel containing your print and the acetone (the incredibly stupid way)
    the vapour generated slowly melts the exterior layers of plastic, and will with time smooth out any ridge marks, and leave the print with a surface similar to injection molded plastic.</p>
    <h2>The Finer Points of Sanding</h2>
    <h4>Respirators non-optional</h4>
    <p>Dust is dangeous too.</p>
    <p>The number one thing to keep in mind with sanding your 3D prints is that without a mask you will be inhaling tiny particles of plastic either ABS, PLA, Nylon etc none of which are paticularly good for or kind to your soft squishy lungs.
    A high quality respirator at all times is not only neccessary but is required if you want to preserve your health, 3D printing is at a stage that a lot of the long term health effects that may result from sanding, melting, or even eating from3d printed products are unknown.
  So be careful.</p>
    <h2>Ostrich feathers</h2>
    <h4>Do Modern Dinosaurs Hold The Key To Our Future?</h4>
    <p>He said sarcastically as he ran out of time to think through these pages beyond the basics.</p>
    <p>The most essential thing when finishing a 3D print is to take care at all stages, to pay attention to what the material is doing, and to not set fire to everything around you when using acetone vapour.</p>
