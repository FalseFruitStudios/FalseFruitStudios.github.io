    <h1>Tools</h1>
    <p>When it comes to 3D printing the 3D printer, and filament you use play only a small roll in the quality of the finished product, below is a list of tools,and items that are always useful to have on hand when 3D printing.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Razorblades</li>
        <li>Sandpaper</li>
        <li>Scissors</li>
        <li>Superglue</li>
        <li>Ostrich Feathers</li>
        <li>Masking tape</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With the above tools you can get a piece straight from the print bed to an almost finished state that can be used as is or can be further refined with further finishing, these final finishing methods can be as simple
      or as complicated as you make them but a list of tools that make these final finishing touches much easier can be found below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Dremel (or other multitool)</li>
        <li>Airbrush compressor & airbrushes</li>
        <li>Soldering Iron (for melting pieces)</li>
        <li>Bondo or other fillers</li>
        <li>Spray primer & clear coat</li>
        <li>Acetone for "Vapour Finishing"</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of these tools, and their uses within finishing a 3D print are self explanitory while, some such as the Acetone for "vapour Finishing" a piece are more complicated, and potentially destructive processes that are covered further in detail elsewhere on this site. </p>
    <p>This is a site dedicated to the exploration of 3D printing, and sharing my own personal projects, and techniques.</p>
