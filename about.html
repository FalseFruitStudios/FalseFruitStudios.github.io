    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>3D printing is a medium that has interested me greatly for the last 4 years with my purchase of a printer in late 2015 as an early Christmas present to myself cementing my interest in the technology.
    Since then I have created, and designed 3D printed pieces to fill real needs or to act as art piece. During this time I have experimented with, and learnt many techniques that when used together or alone
    result in fantastic professional quality prints.</p>

    <p>This website has been created as part of a university assignment.</p>
    <p>It exists largely for the sake of existing, searching for a topic i settled upon one that I had an existing interest in, and experience with</p>
    <p> As such the site overall is rather sparse, and dissapointing for any everyday person that stumbles upon it, though I do hope what content I do have on here will prove to be at least a little helpful</p>
